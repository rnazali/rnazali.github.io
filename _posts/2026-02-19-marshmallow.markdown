I hope we will always find ourselves beneath the same quiet sky,
hands warmed by the same small fire,
roasting marshmallows as if time itself were kind to us.

And if life, in all its restless cruelty,
should ever keep us from that simple joy,
may we find each other again in the next one—
and finish what we began beside the fire.
