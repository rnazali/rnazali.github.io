title:  "Creating hassle-free and markdown-based blog with Jekyll"

I've heard Jekyll for a really long time but ended up never tried it, until now!

It just happened that I need some kind of place where I can put/share all I have in my mind on a custom platform that 
are reliable, simple, customizable enough, with my own domain, and preferably free without any subscription commitment.

After some reading, I thought hosting Jekyll-based site on a GitHub Page checks all my requirements. 
This post documents all my hiccups for setting up this site, so you don't have to!

Expect small amount of time investment reading the official documentation of GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and some SO-ing.
Especially if you are like me who never touched ruby nor jekyll before.

The super-cool thing about this stack is that, after a minimal setup on `_config.yml` and some optional theme 
overriding to your need, you ended up with a framework that accepts pure markdown-formatted plain text,
ready to keep all of your future writing with style without any html coding involved! 

After that and so on, creating a new post is as simple as pushing a new markdown file and Jekyll will automatically 
decorate the content according to the applied theme. Again, no html involved! ❤️


## Getting Started 

### Creating the repo

You need to create a public repository with exact name format: `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io`, 
just like the URL of this site. 
The site will notice and automatically set some configuration for you.

When you later reach the step to deploy the site, you will notice that GitHub seems to understand that
you are filling the repo with Jekyll-formatted source code and automatically decides to builds and deploys it
accordingly without any further tweaking needed with GitHub Actions.

### Installing the prerequisite and initializing empty Jekyll site

At the moment of this writing, GitHub and Jekyll documentation seems to lack some of the trivial steps to properly
install the requirements and initialize the Jekyll site (or maybe I'm just the one that missed it, 
currently I leaned towards the latter).
I followed both of them and ended up being thrown by version mismatch error when adding Jekyll globally to my local
machine.

So, this is how I got all of this working :
1. Install Ruby, RubyGems, and `bundler` gem
   - This is the official page for [installing Ruby and RubyGems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
   - Since I'm using Ubuntu, I followed this [Ubuntu Installation link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) specifically, 
   with some note:
     - When setting the RubyGem path, I opted for `~/.gems` instead of the suggested `~/gems`. This is highly 
     opinionated, but IMO this is much cleaner and properly merges with style from other stacks 
     such as `.docker`, `.git`, etc.

       | ![](/assets/2023-08-02/ruby%20gems%20path.png) |
       |:----------------------------------------------:|
       | *IMO should be `~/.gems` instead of `~/gems`*  |

     - When adding gems, you only need to add `bundler` for now, as adding `jekyll` now seems to result in version 
     mismatch error, or at least what has happened to me.
     
       The correct command for me would be: `gem install bundler`.

       | ![](/assets/2023-08-02/install%20jekyll%20bundler.png) |
       |:------------------------------------------------------:|
       |           *No need to install `jekyll` here*           |

2. On your root repository, initialize the project by running: `bundle init`. 
   - If you came from Python environment, this can be identically compared (by overly simplifying) as creating a new
   `venv` with empty `requirements.txt`, where the `Gemfile` would contains all the required dependencies, or _gems_.
   - Confirm that it creates a `Gemfile` file inside your repo: 

     |      ![](/assets/2023-08-02/bundle%20init.png)       |
     |:----------------------------------------------------:|
     | *`Gemfile` is just like python's `requirements.txt`* |

3. Add `jekyll` gem by running `bundle add jekyll`.
   - Notice that `jekyll` is being added inside `Gemfile`

     |   ![](/assets/2023-08-02/bundle%20add%20jekyll.png)    |
     |:------------------------------------------------------:|
     | *Notice that `jekyll` is being added inside `Gemfile`* |

   - A `Gemfile.lock` would also automatically be added. Don't forget to include it on commit!

     |               ![](/assets/2023-08-02/gemfile.lock.png)               |
     |:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
     | *IMO this is just the same as `Pipfile.lock` or `package-lock.json`* |

4. Initialize empty Jekyll site with: `bundle exec jekyll new --force --skip-bundle .` (don't forget the trailing dot!).
    - `--force` forces creation even if given path already exists
    - `--skip-bundle` skips 'bundle install', as we need some tweaking before actually install all the dependencies

   | ![](/assets/2023-08-02/bundle%20exec%20jekyll%20new.png) |
   |:--------------------------------------------------------:|
   | *Notice that fresh Jekyll site is being set up for you*  |

5. Now if we peek inside our `Gemfile`, there will be plenty of contents inside it. Surprisingly there is an explicit
instruction on how to use jekyll with GitHub Pages:

   |                  ![](/assets/2023-08-02/gemfile%20note%20on%20github%20page.png)                  |
   |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
   | *The default Gemfile seems to indicate as if majority of people only install jekyll for GH Pages* |

    - First, we disable the jekyll dependency by adding a hash as a form of comment. 
      - so `gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3.2"`
      - will become `#gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3.2"`
    - Open [GitHub Pages Dependency Versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/), look for `github-pages` and take a 
    note on the version.

       | ![](/assets/2023-08-02/ghpages%20dependency%20version.png) |
       |:----------------------------------------------------------:|
       |        *As of this writing, the version was `228`.*        |

    - Add this line somewhere inside the `Gemfile`: 
      - `gem "github-pages", "~> 228", group: :jekyll_plugins`
      - (I strongly guess the order doesn't really matter, but probably should be placed some line below the `jekyll`
      dependency for readability purpose)
    - The edited `Gemfile` would look similarly like this

      |                    ![](/assets/2023-08-02/gemfile%20after%20edit.png)                     |
      |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
      | *Don't forget to change the `228` to the newest available version you have on your time.* |

6. Since we skipped the bundle installation before, now is the good time to install all the dependencies, 
so run `bundle install`.

   |                   ![](/assets/2023-08-02/bundle%20install.png)                    |
   |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
   | *2 days trying ruby & bundler environment and I'm starting to like it already 🤓* |

7. All the required dependencies should be installed. Now you can run your jekyll site locally 
with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

   |                             ![](/assets/2023-08-02/bundle%20exec%20jekyll%20serve.png)                             |
   |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
   | *Notice that by default it will serve on port 4000 of your localhost. <br/>You can opt to change the port number.* |

8. Open your browser and the development site should be in `http://127.0.0.1:4000` by default.

   |                           ![](/assets/2023-08-02/the%20site.png)                            |
   |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
   | *This is how your freshly installed jekyll (with `github-pages` dependency) will look like* |

Here you successfully create a fresh installation of a Jekyll site that will be supported by GitHub Pages.

You can actually deploy it right away, but you may want to configure something in this same development session.

## Configuring the site

### Choose your template

The default installation uses [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and I found it to be super okay for my needs.

You can find [list of available free theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/). 
Know that each theme has its own way to set or configure, so be sure to read the official documentation of theme that 
you picked.

You may want to also  know that there are plenty of paid jekyll theme, and you can always opt for it. 
But I think going that way defies the purpose of simple & free aspect in the first place.

On a quick search, I found a free theme that probably suits you best as an alternative to the already available theme.
Check this out: [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

### Update the `_config.yml`

All Jekyll ste settings is found inside `_config.yml` and you may want to configure it to your need.

**Important**: Jekyll `serve` supports auto-reloading by default to ease your development session. 
But any change introduced inside `_config.yml` will not be auto-reloaded, so always restart your development server
after each of the change you have done in this file (I found it the hard way 😭).

### Optionally edit or override how the theme behaves

Jekyll uses [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) alongside
[Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) for the template system.
So this is basically just like [Java's Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/), 
[Python's Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/),
or [Django's DTL](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/templates/).

You can override anything by including the exact file you want to override inside the repo. For starter, 
[on this site](https://github.com/rnazali/rnazali.github.io/tree/main/_includes),
I've overridden `footer.html` by including a file with exact name with exact path according to the currently 
used theme (which is [minima-2.5.1](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/releases/tag/v2.5.1)).

## Deploying the site

Assuming that your site is placed on the root of the repository, what you need to do is to only push the code to the repo!

GitHub seems to notice when you pushed a Jekyll-based site on your personal GitHub Pages repo, 
and since the default configuration is to deploy from the `/(root)` directory of the `main` branch, 
I managed to seamlessly deploy my site without configure anything. 
There will be a default GitHub Actions that build the entire site and triggered on each push to the `main` branch. 

Wait for the pipeline (took ~50s for me), and confirm that your site is up! 🥳🎉

So now you got free & nice looking site waiting to contain all your writings!

You don't need to mess up with this whole configuration again, or maybe only once in a couple of 
months when you need some change in UI or behavior. 

Your next step would be to read more about [Post formatting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
and is outside the scope of this article.

And so this marks the end of the story on how to deploy the site you are currently reading right now.

I hope some people will find this useful!
